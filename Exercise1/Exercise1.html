            <p>As the value of the digital currency has climbed, so has the amount of energy needed to keep this online
                economy running, which now exceeds the energy use of 159 individual countries, according to one
                controversial estimate.</p>

                focus on how you can use html typography intentionally!!!!!
            </p>
            <p>
                many of the same rules apply to type online as they do in other contexts,
                what does a readable paragraph look like, how can you establish hierarchy, or enforce a grid?
            </p>
            <p>
                one thing to be mindful of is how html and css comes with default styling that may not be what
                you want, the spacing between these paragraphs as an example.
