        <h2>2009</h2>
        <p>In 2009 any normal computer CPU could have mined bitcoin at a profit of $5 USD a day.
            Only a few people were mining bitcoin at this time and it still wasnâ€™t used as a viable source of commerce.
            Nobody knew the impact Bitcoin would end up having.

        <h2>2010</h2>
        <p>In October of 2010 the code for mining bitcoin was released to the general public. This
            started the era of hobbiests and crypto nerds. Miners began adding GPU's (Graphic Processing Units) to their
            hardware. GPU's allowed for greater processing capabilities because they hash at a higher rate than CPU's.
            GPU's
            worked nearly 50-100 times faster than the average CPU. This
            introduction increased mining difficulty, in turn driving the need to improve hardware. The increase in
            hardware
            created an increase in energy consumption.

        <h2>2011-2012</h2>
        <p>In June of 2011 a new kind of hardware revolutionized bitcoin mining. The FPGA (Field
            Programmable Gate Arrays) became the new rage in bitcoin mining. Hobbyiests could be tweaked to be useful
            for
            bitcoin mining. FPGA's were extremeley popular because they consumed about 3 times less power than the
            average
            GPU.

        <h2>2013-Current</h2>
        <p>In 2013 the new and current standard to bitcoin techonology was introduced in the
            form of
            ASIC's. ASIC's have been around since the 1980's to increase graphic capabilities, but in 2013 they were
            created
            specifically for the purpose of bitcoin mining. ASIC unites increased the spead of algorithm soving by quite
            a
            lot. It has been estimated that ASIC's work 100,000 times faster than the most powerful CPU at calculating
            hashes. ASIC units are extremeley energy consuming and expensive. They brought bitcoin mining from hobby to
            industry.
